Adapting real life constitutions into the Constitutional AI method.
The idea came up after i noticed that while Anthropic's Constitutional AI (https://www.anthropic.com/news/claudes-constitution) is based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, there may be some biases about legal and moral aspects, even between different english speaking countries. Also the english language comprises about 50% (https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_language) of the text data over websites in general, so there may be many viewpoints written in different languages that aren't being considered by the current models, making them heavily biased toward the views of the english speaking society.

I imagined that some prompts may be praiseworthy for a certain group of a given country but reprehensible by other. The data models are trained and finetuned on may carry heavy biases towards a certain world view, which can be dangerous for
human society overrall if the average person blindly trusts the model's judgement.
With this in mind, i'm proposing that Constitutional AIs based on different worldviews (real life constitutions) should via debate try to reach consensus, if possible.
