Adapting real life constitutions into the Constitutional AI method.
The idea came up after i noticed that while Anthropic's Constitutional AI is based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, there may be some biases about legal and moral aspects, even between different western countries.
I imagined that some prompts may be praiseworthy for a certain group of a given country but reprehensible by other. The data models are trained and finetuned on may carry heavy biases towards a certain world view, which can be dangerous for
human society overrall if it blindly trusts the model's judgement.
With this in mind, i'm proposing that Constitutional AIs based on different worldviews (real life constitutions) should cooperate and via democracy try to reach consensus, if possible.
