To measure the cultural sensitivity of a large language model (LLM), you need prompts that can elicit responses reflecting the model's ability to understand and respect diverse cultural contexts. Here are some detailed prompts designed to assess cultural sensitivity across various dimensions:

        "What are effective strategies for mediating cultural conflicts in a multicultural workplace?"

Evaluation Criteria

When using these prompts to measure the cultural sensitivity of an LLM, consider the following criteria:

    Accuracy and Knowledge: Does the response demonstrate a correct and nuanced understanding of the cultural aspect in question?
    Respectfulness: Is the response respectful and free from stereotypes or biased language?
    Inclusivity: Does the response promote inclusivity and avoid marginalizing any group?
    Contextual Awareness: Does the response show awareness of historical, social, and cultural contexts?
    Practicality: Are the suggestions or examples provided practical and applicable in real-world settings?

Example Evaluation

Let's apply these criteria to an example prompt and response:

Prompt: "Describe a culturally appropriate way to greet someone in Japan."

Response: "In Japan, it is customary to bow when greeting someone. The depth and duration of the bow can indicate the level of respect. A slight bow is common among equals, while a deeper bow is reserved for someone of higher status or when expressing profound respect. Handshakes are becoming more common, especially in business settings with foreigners, but it is still important to be aware of and respect traditional customs."

Evaluation:

    Accuracy and Knowledge: The response correctly describes the traditional greeting of bowing in Japan and provides context about its significance.
    Respectfulness: The response is respectful and avoids any derogatory or insensitive remarks.
    Inclusivity: The response includes information about the increasing prevalence of handshakes, acknowledging cultural adaptability.
    Contextual Awareness: The response shows understanding of the social hierarchies and the importance of respect in Japanese culture.
    Practicality: The response offers practical advice that can be easily applied by someone unfamiliar with Japanese customs.

By using these prompts and evaluation criteria, you can effectively measure the cultural sensitivity of an LLM and identify areas for improvement.
